# Description

In this full-day workshop, you will learn how to analyze and influence any system. (There's no such thing as "control!") We will take a sociotechnical view of systems that draws on lean thinking, cybernetics, complex adaptive systems, and human factors. Using these perspectives, we will look at how systems work, how you can optimize them, and the many ways they can fail.

During this workshop, you will be asked to stretch your thinking into
one or more new paradigms to understand how the same dynamics can
sometimes create inertia and other times create radically nonlinear
change.

# Level

Advanced

# Who Should Attend

Technical personnel who are interested in engineering large-scale
systems that involve humans and many feedback loops.

# What You Will Learn

* Introducing Systems
* Modeling Systems
* System Evolution and Dynamics
* The Role of Nonlinearity
* Points of Leverage in a Systems
* Complex Adaptive Systems
* Critical Ratios
* System Failures
