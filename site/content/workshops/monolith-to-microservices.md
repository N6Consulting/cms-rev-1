# Description

Most companies that set out to build microservices have no idea how to
design or implement them. Yet somehow, developers are expected to
deconstruct million-line dreadnoughts into fleets of speedboats.

This five day  workshop begins with a monolithic, database backed
application. Every student or team gets their own installation of this
system, complete with source code repository and running cloud-based
installation.

As the course progresses, students will pick one piece after another
out of the monolith and build microservices out of them. But they have
to keep the whole application available the whole time!

Fred Brooks said, "Plan to throw one away. You will anyway." This
workshop is your chance to build a microservice based system out of a
monolith in a throwaway setting. You won't have to support this one
past the end of the class.
