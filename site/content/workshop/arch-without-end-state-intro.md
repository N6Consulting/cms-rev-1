# Summary

Simple systems are easier to evolve over time. Unfortunately, simple architecture is not easy to design or build. 

This introductory class teaches the foundational skills that every architect should possess: how to explore the boundary of your system, identify interfaces, design for availability, and communicate up, down, sideways, and into the future.

# Description

There is no end state. We must all learn to build systems that evolve and grow. In this course, Michael Nygard introduces the fundamental skills and concepts of architecture, with a particular eye toward systems that admit changeâ€”bending and flexing through time. 

This workshop includes both teaching and hands-on design sessions. Design sessions will be paper and whiteboard work in small groups. You'll work on real problems drawn from a variety of industries.

# Prerequisite knowledge

Experience in software development. No architecture experience is required.

* Explain the architecture qualities and what it means to prioritize them.
* Learn several architecture patterns and styles to apply in real systems.
