Our workshops are designed to span the lifecycle of software: from
conception to deployment, and on into a future of change and
pressure. We have workshops aimed at different skill levels as well,
from developers, to aspiring software architects, to experienced
architects that want to get current on cloud-native and microservice
systems.
